# ![Logo](Boolli-icon-64x64.png) Boolli

Boolli is a boolean expressions interpreter.

What is Boolli able to do? Saying `true` or `false` given a boolean expression!

To Boolli, a boolean expression is something generated by this `EBNF` grammar:

  ```
  expr: factor((and | or) factor)*
  factor: (not)* factor | boolean | LPAR expr RPAR
  boolean: true | false | 0 | 1
  ```

Bolli is composed of:
- A lexer
- A parser
- An interpreter

The base data structure is Abstract Syntax Tree

How can it be helpful?
- To understand how to parse a simple grammar
- When you substitute boolean tokens with `Func<bool>` (even `Func<Task<bool>>`) tokens and define a simple rule system
